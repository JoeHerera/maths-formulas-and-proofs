square root of(1) = 1
now lets start by adding 3 to the number 
in the square root wish is one.
so square root of(4) and its = 2
now add the same 3 to the number in th eroot
but add 2 with the 3 also so 5.
we get square root of (9)= 3
stay with me now.
last time we added 5( we added 3 than 2).
now we take that 5 tahat we aaded and add 2 to it.
so we add 7 now.
we get square root of (16) wish is =4.
now we do the same thing,
last time we added 7 so now we add 9(7 and the extra 2 that were adding every time)
so sqaure root(25) and its=5
now we add the 9 that we aaaded previously with a extra 2 like before
so we add 11 to 25
we get square root(36) wish=6
and so on we keep adding 2 to the number that we added,
we started by adding 2 and everytime we add 2 to the number that we added.
the conclusion is that this method shows us the square root every number
with no decimals.
1,2,3,4,5,6... we found every square root that gets us to these numbers.
this theory is so fun and the coincidence is so intresting
we are just adding 2 and 2 and so on.
so the conclusion is that if we have a serie that starts with 3 with a 2 that is added always
and put them in square roots starting with oen and adding them we will get every single numbers with no decimals.
