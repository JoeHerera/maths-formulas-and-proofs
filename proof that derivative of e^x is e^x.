we have a function of:
f(x)=e^x
lets add ln on each side:
ln(f(x))=ln(e^x)
so ln(f(x))=x
lets do derivative for this:
the derivative of ln(f(x)) is f'(x)/f(x)
and the derivative of x is 1.
so we have f'(x)/f(x)=1
lets take f(x) to the opposite side so now we multiply it by 1
now we have f'(x)=f(x)
and according to the function we started with:
f(x)=e^x
so we replace f(x) with e^x in f'(x)=f(x).
and we get f'(x)=e^x.
so the derivative of f(x)=e^x is e^x.
so we proved that the derivative of e^x is e^x.
